TOPIC
    Windows PowerShell Help System

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Displays help about Windows PowerShell cmdlets and concepts.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Windows PowerShell Help describes Windows PowerShell cmdlets,
    functions, scripts, and modules, and explains concepts, including
    the elements of the Windows PowerShell language.

    Windows PowerShell does not include help files, but you can read the
    help topics online, or use the Update-Help cmdlet to download help files
    to your computer and then use the Get-Help cmdlet to display the help
    topics at the command line.

    You can also use the Update-Help cmdlet to download updated help files
    as they are released so that your local help content is never obsolete.

    Without help files, Get-Help displays auto-generated help for cmdlets,
    functions, and scripts.


  ONLINE HELP
    You can find help for Windows PowerShell online in the TechNet Library
    beginning at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=108518.

    To open online help for any cmdlet or function, type:

        Get-Help <cmdlet-name> -Online

  UPDATE-HELP
    To download and install help files on your computer:

       1. Start Windows PowerShell with the "Run as administrator" option.
       2. Type:

          Update-Help

    After the help files are installed, you can use the Get-Help cmdlet to
    display the help topics. You can also use the Update-Help cmdlet to
    download updated help files so that your local help files are always
    up-to-date.

    For more information about the Update-Help cmdlet, type:

       Get-Help Update-Help -Online

LODCTR
       Updates registry values related to performance counters.
Usage:
       LODCTR <INI-filename>
             Installs counter text strings. INI-filename is the name of the
             initialization file that contains the counter name definitions
             and explain text for an extensible counter DLL.

       LODCTR /C:<filename>
             Upgrades counter text strings using <filename>

       LODCTR /H:<filename>
             Upgrades help text strings using <filename>

       LODCTR /L:<LangID>
             Specifies the language for the /C and /H commands

       LODCTR /S:<Backup-filename>
             Saves the current perf registry strings and info to
             <Backup-filename>

       LODCTR /R
             Rebuilds perf registry from scratch based on current registry
             settings and backup INI files.

       LODCTR /R:<filename>
             Restores perf registry strings & info using <filename>

       LODCTR /T:<service-name>
             Sets the specified performance counter provider as trusted.

       LODCTR /Q
             Displays performance counter provider information.

       LODCTR /Q:<service-name>
             Displays performance counter provider information for a
             specific provider.

       LODCTR /E:<service-name>
             Enables the performance counter provider.

       LODCTR /D:<service-name>
             Disables the performance counter provider.

       LODCTR /M:<Counter-Manifest> [<Installation-Path>]
             Installs a v2.0 performance counter provider using the specified
             XML manifest.

             The installation requires a full path to the DLL containing the
             performance counter resources (localized  strings). The path
             to the DLL will be determined as follows:

             If the applicationIdentity attribute in the manifest is a full
             path, that will be used.

             Otherwise, if <Installation-Path> is provided and is a full
             path, that will be used.

             Otherwise, if <Counter-Manifest> is a full path, the directory
             from <Counter-Manifest> will be combined with the DLL name from
             the applicationIdentity attribute in the manifest.

             Otherwise, the current directory will be combined with the DLL
             name from the applicationIdentity attribute in the manifest.

Note: Any arguments with spaces in the names must be enclosed within double
quotation marks.
